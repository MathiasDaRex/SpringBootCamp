Advanced Mappings
	in the database, we most likely will have
		- multiple tables
		- Relationships between tables
	Need to model this with hibernate
	
One-to-One Mapping
	An instructor can have an "instructor detail" entity
	similar to an "instructor profile"

One-to-Many Mapping
	An instructor can have many courses

Many-to-One
	Many courses can map to one instructor
	
Many-to-Many
	A course can have may students
	A student can have many courses
	
Primary Key and Foreign Key
	Primary key: identify a unique row in a table
	
	Foreign key - Link tables together
				- a field in one table that refers to primary key in
				  another table
				
Cascade
	We can cascade operations
	Apply the same operation to related entities.
	if we save our instructor, it cascades and does the same
	operation in Instructor Detaul
	
	if we delete an instructor, we should also delete the
	instructor_detail
	this is CASCADE DELETE
	
	it really depends on the situation,
	if we have students to courses, we shouldn't delete the courses also
	
Fetch types: Eagre vs Lazy Loading
	when we fetch/retrieve data, should we retrieve EVERYTHING?
		- Eager will retrieve everything
		- Lazy will retrieve on request
	if we have an instructor with multiple courses, should we retrieve
	everything, or only on request?

Uni-directional: one way relationship.
	we load the instructor, from that we can access the instructor detail

Bi-directional: two way relationship
	we load the instructor, from that we can access the instructor detail,
	but we can also reference the instructor from the instructor detail
	
More on foreign key
	- Main purpose is to preserve relationship between tables
		Referential integrity
		
	- Prevents operations that would destroy relationship
	- Ensures only valid data is inserted into the foreign key column
		can only contain valid reference to primary key in other table

Development process: one-to-one
	1 - prep work - define database tables
	2 - create IntstructorDetail class
	3 - Create Instructor class
	4 - Create Main App
		- we will create Spring Boot command line app
		- leverage our DAO pattern as in previous
	
Entity Lifecycle
	Operations 	-	Desription
	Detach			If entity is detached, it's not associated with a Hibernate session
	Merge 			If instance is detached from session, then merge will reattach to session
	Persist			Transitions new instances to managed state. next flush/commit will save in db
	Remove			Transitions managed entity to be removed. next flush/commit will delete from db
	Refresh 		Reload/synch object with data from db. prevents stale data

@OneToOne - cascade types
	PERSIST 		if entity is persisted/saved, related entity will also be persisted/saved
	REMOVE 			if entity is removed/deleted, related entity will also be deleted
	REFRESH 		if entity is refreshed, related entity will also be refreshed
	DETACH			if entity is detached(not associated w/ session), then related entity will also be detached
	MERGE			if entity is merged, then related entity will also be merged
	ALL 			All of above cascade types

By default, no operations are cascaded

Bi-Directional
	If load an IntstructorDetail object, and we'd like to get the associated Instructor
	We can't do that, because it's currently a uni-directional relationship  
	Instructor->IntstructorDetail

	Bi-directional relationship is the solution
	Instructor<->IntstructorDetail

	To use Bi-Directional we can keep the existing database schema
	No changes required for the database, simply update the java code

	Dev process:
	1 - Make updates to InstructorDetail class
		- Add new field to reference Instructor
		- Add getter/setter methods for Instructor
		- Add @OneToOne annotation		--- 	
		@OneToOne(mappedBy("instructorDetail") <- Refers to "instructorDetail" property in "Instructor" class
	2 - Create main App
	
	mappedBy tells Hibernate 
		Look at the InstructorDetail property in the Instructor class
		Use information from the Instructor class @JoinColumn
		To help find associated instructor

Cascade Delete InstructorDetail->Instructor object

If we only want to delete the InstructorDetail object, we have to mdify the cascade type on the InstructorDetail entiy
by not adding CascadeType.DELETE


Fetch Types: Eager vs Lazy Loading
	When we fetch/retrieve data, should we retrieve EVERYTHING?
	This can effect our applications performance
		- Eager will retrieve everything
		- Lazy will retrieve on request only
		
	Eager Loading
		- Eager loading will load all dependent entites
			- Load instructor and all of their courses at once
			
			if we load courses, and Eager load every student on it, that can turn a performance nightmare
	
	BEST PACTICE - ONLY LOAD DATA WHEN IT'S ABSOLUTELY NEEDED
	prefer Lazy loading instead of Eager loading
	
	
	Lazy Loading
		- Lazy loading will load the main entity first
			- Load dependent entities on demand
			
	Real world use case: a searching page for instructors
		
		on the Master View we can search instructors by name, and have a button for detailed view.
		so we only load the instructors first.(LAZY)
		
		on the Detail View we retrieve the entity and neccessary dependent entities.
		so Load Instructor AND their Courses
	
	When we define the mapping relationship, we can specify the fetch type: EAGER or LAZY
		public class Instructor {	
		...
			@OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy="instructor")
			private List<Course> courses;
		...
	}
	
	Default Fetch Types 
		@OneToOne - FetchType.EAGER
		@OneToMany - FetchType.LAZY
		@ManyToOne - FetchType.EAGER
		@ManyToMany - FetchType.LAZY
		
	More about Lazy Loading
		When we lazy load, the data is only retrieved on demand
		However, this requires an open Hibernate session
			- need a connection to database to retrieve data
		If Hibernate session is closed, and we attempt to retrieve lazy data
			- Hibernate will throw an exception
			

@OneToMany: Uni-directional
	A course can have many reviews
	Uni-directional
		Course -> review
			   -> review
			   -> review
	Real-world project requirement:
		if we delete a course, also delete the reviews
		Reviews without a course ... has no meaning
		so we can add support for all cascade types, even delete
