Custom login form development process

1. Modify Spring Security Configuration to reference custom login form

2. Develom a controller to show it

3. Create custom login form

    - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

for the login page we must make a controller,
but for the loginProcesingURL it's not required, we get it for free
loginProcesingURL will be handled by the Spring Security Filters

We send form data to the processing url we configured, must be POST

Spring Security defines default names for login form fields

  for user names:  username
  for passwords:   password

Context path, context root
the root path for the web application.
Context Root: my-ecommerce-app
http://localhost:8080/my-ecommerce-app

@ <- gives us access to context  path dynamically
we can add that to links, like form submissions
if we change the context path the links will still work
much better then hard coding the context path

Recommended to use it, best practice!
